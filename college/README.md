# Covid-19 Cases in U.S. Colleges (2020-2023) - MySQL Queries

This repository contains MySQL queries to analyze and gain insights from the [Covid-19 dataset](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) released by The New York Times, which tracks Covid-19 cases reported at U.S. colleges and universities during the 2020-2023 academic year.


## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from The New York Times, which surveyed U.S. colleges and universities to track Covid-19 cases among students, faculty, staff, and other workers during the 2020-2023 academic year.

- Dataset link: [Colleges Covid-19 Data (CSV)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/colleges/colleges.csv)
- The dataset includes information such as:
  - Date of report
  - College name
  - Location (state, county, city)
  - Total reported cases since the start of the pandemic
  - Cases reported in 2021
  - Methodological notes
 
  
[The data file](college.csv) contains the following columns:

| Column | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **date** | The date of the most recent update |
| **state** | The state where the college is located in the U.S. |
| **county** | The county in each state where the college is located | 
| **city** | The city where the college is located |
| **ipeds_id** | The Integegrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) ID number for the college in question |
| **cases** | The total number of reported Covid-19 cases among university students and staff across all fields, including individuals in high-risk roles such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and medical students, from the start of the pandemic|
| **cases_2021** | Cases reported specifically since January 1, 2021 only |
| **notes** | Any special notes on the data collection |

Colleges and universities that have reported zero cases will be listed with a zero for cases, while colleges which have not reported data will have a blank in the cases field.

- Trends in Covid-19 cases by region
- Comparison of reported cases across institutions
- Analyzing the number of cases reported in 2021
- Investigating colleges with zero cases or missing data

## Setup and Usage
